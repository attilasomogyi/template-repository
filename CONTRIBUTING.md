# Contributing to template-repository Project

We would love for you to contribute to template-repository Project and help make
it even better than it is today!  As a contributor, here are the guidelines we
would like you to follow:

- [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)
- [Question or Problem?](#got-a-question-or-problem)
- [Issues and Bugs](#found-a-bug)
- [Feature Requests](#missing-a-feature)
- [Submission Guidelines](#submission-guidelines)
- [Coding Rules](#coding-rules)
- [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit-message-format)

## Code of Conduct

Help us keep Angular open and inclusive.
Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct][coc].

## Got a Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub
issues for bug reports and feature requests.  Instead, we recommend using [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/template-repository) to ask
support-related questions. When creating a new question on Stack Overflow, make
sure to add the `template-repository` tag.

Stack Overflow is a much better place to ask questions since:

- there are thousands of people willing to help on Stack Overflow
- questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your
question/answer might help someone else
- Stack Overflow's voting system assures that the best answers are prominently
visible.

To save your and our time, we will systematically close all issues that are
requests for general support and redirect people to Stack Overflow.

## Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by [submitting an
issue](#submitting-an-issue) to our [GitHub Repository][github]. Even better,
you can [submit a Pull Request](#submitting-a-pull-request) with a fix.

## Missing a Feature?

You can _request_ a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submitting-an-issue)
to our GitHub Repository.  If you would like to _implement_ a new feature,
please consider the size of the change in order to determine the right steps
to proceed:

- For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that
it can be discussed.  This process allows us to better coordinate our efforts,
prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is
successfully accepted into the project.

 **Note**: Adding a new topic to the documentation, or significantly re-writing
 a topic, counts as a major feature.

- **Small Features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a Pull
Request](#submitting-a-pull-request).

## Submission Guidelines

### Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker. An issue for your
problem might already exist and the discussion might inform you of workarounds
readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug, we
need to reproduce and confirm it.  In order to reproduce bugs, we require that
you provide a minimal reproduction.  Having a minimal reproducible scenario
gives us a wealth of important information without going back and forth to you
with additional questions.

A minimal reproduction allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out a coding
problem) as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem.

We require a minimal reproduction to save maintainers' time and ultimately be
able to fix more bugs.  Often, developers find coding problems themselves while
preparing a minimal reproduction.  We understand that sometimes it might be hard
to extract essential bits of code from a larger codebase, but we really need to
isolate the problem before we can fix it.

Unfortunately, we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal
reproduction, so if we don't hear back from you, we are going to close an issue
that doesn't have enough info to be reproduced.

You can file new issues by selecting from our [new issue
templates](https://github.com/attilasomogyi/template-repository/issues/new/choose)
and filling out the issue template.

### Submitting a Pull Request

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

1. Search [GitHub](https://github.com/attilasomogyi/template-repository/pulls) for
   an open or closed PR that relates to your submission.  You don't want to
   duplicate existing efforts.

2. Be sure that an issue describes the problem you're fixing, or documents the
   design for the feature you'd like to add.  Discussing the design upfront
   helps to ensure that we're ready to accept your work.

3. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
   the attilasomogyi/template-repository repo.

4. In your forked repository, make your changes in a new git branch:

   ```shell
   git checkout -b my-fix-branch main
   ```

5. Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.

6. Follow our [Coding Rules](#coding-rules).

7. Run the full test suite, as described in the [developer
documentation][dev-doc], and ensure that all tests pass.

8. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our
[commit message conventions](#commit-message-format).  Adherence to these
conventions is necessary because release notes are automatically generated
from these messages.

   ```shell
   git commit --all
   ```

   Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add"
and "rm" edited files.

9. Push your branch to GitHub:

   ```shell
   git push origin my-fix-branch
   ```

10. In GitHub, send a pull request to `template-repository:main`.

### Reviewing a Pull Request

The PlantUML settings project team reserves the right not to accept pull
requests from community members who haven't been good citizens of the community.
Such behavior includes not following the [PlantUML Settings code of
conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and applies within or outside of PlantUML Settings
managed channels.

#### Addressing review feedback

If we ask for changes via code reviews then:

1. Make the required updates to the code.

2. Re-run the test suites to ensure tests are still passing.

3. Create a fixup commit and push to your GitHub repository (this will update
your Pull Request):

   ```shell
   git commit --all --fixup HEAD
   git push
   ```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

##### Updating the commit message

A reviewer might often suggest changes to a commit message (for example, to add
more context for a change or adhere to our [commit message
guidelines](#commit-message-format)).  In order to update the commit
message of the last commit on your branch:

1. Check out your branch:

   ```shell
   git checkout my-fix-branch
   ```

2. Amend the last commit and modify the commit message:

   ```shell
   git commit --amend
   ```

3. Push to your GitHub repository:

   ```shell
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```

> NOTE:
> If you need to update the commit message of an earlier commit, you can use
> `git rebase` in interactive mode.
> See the [git docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#_interactive_mode) for
> more details.

#### After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull
the changes from the main (upstream) repository:

- Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your
local shell as follows:

  ```shell
  git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
  ```

- Check out the main branch:

  ```shell
  git checkout main -f
  ```

- Delete the local branch:

  ```shell
  git branch -D my-fix-branch
  ```

- Update your local `main` with the latest upstream version:

  ```shell
  git pull --ff upstream main
  ```

## Coding Rules

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as
you are working:

- All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more specs (unit-tests).
- All public API methods **must be documented**.

### We follow

## File and Directory name conventions

- File name regexp check: `^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*\.[a-z0-9]+$`
- Directory name regexp check: `^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$`
- Keep it as simple as possible

## Commit Message Format

_This specification is inspired by and supersedes the [AngularJS commit message
format][commit-message-format]._

We have very precise rules over how our Git commit messages must be formatted.
This format leads to **easier to read commit history**.

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body**, and a **footer**.

```text
<header>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The `header` is mandatory and must conform to the [Commit Message
Header](#commit-message-header) format.

The `body` is mandatory for all commits except for those of type "docs".  When
the body is present it must be at least 20 characters long and must conform to
the [Commit Message Body](#commit-message-body) format.

The `footer` is optional. The [Commit Message Footer](#commit-message-footer)
format describes what the footer is used for and the structure it must have.

### Commit Message Header

```text
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
  │       │             │
  │       │             └─⫸ Summary in present tense.
  |       |                  Not capitalized. No period at the end.
  │       │
  │       └─⫸ Commit Scope: file name without extension
  |                         (for example: changelog, code-of-conduct, readme)
  │
  └─⫸ Commit Type: build|ci|docs|feat|fix|perf|refactor|test
```

The `<type>` and `<summary>` fields are mandatory, the `(<scope>)` field is
optional.

#### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
(example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (examples: CircleCi,
SauceLabs)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

##### Scope

The scope should be the name of the npm package affected (as perceived by the
person reading the changelog generated from commit messages).

The following is the list of supported scopes:

- file name without extension (for example: changelog, code-of-conduct, readme)
- none/empty string: useful for `test` and `refactor` changes that are done
across all packages (e.g. `test: add missing unit tests`) and for docs changes
that are not related to a specific package (e.g. `docs: fix typo in tutorial`).

##### Summary

Use the summary field to provide a succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

#### Commit Message Body

Just as in the summary, use the imperative, present tense: "fix" not "fixed" nor
"fixes".

Explain the motivation for the change in the commit message body. This commit
message should explain _why_ you are making the change. You can include a
comparison of the previous behavior with the new behavior in order to illustrate
the impact of the change.

#### Commit Message Footer

The footer can contain information about breaking changes and deprecations and
is also the place to reference GitHub issues, Jira tickets, and other PRs that
this commit closes or is related to.  For example:

```text
BREAKING CHANGE: <breaking change summary>
<BLANK LINE>
<breaking change description + migration instructions>
<BLANK LINE>
<BLANK LINE>
Fixes #<issue number>
```

or

```text
DEPRECATED: <what is deprecated>
<BLANK LINE>
<deprecation description + recommended update path>
<BLANK LINE>
<BLANK LINE>
Closes #<pr number>
```

Breaking Change section should start with the phrase "BREAKING CHANGE: "
followed by a summary of the breaking change, a blank line, and a detailed
description of the breaking change that also includes migration instructions.

Similarly, a Deprecation section should start with "DEPRECATED: " followed by a
short description of what is deprecated, a blank line, and a detailed
description of the deprecation that also mentions the recommended update path.

### Revert commits

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:`,
followed by the header of the reverted commit.

The content of the commit message body should contain:

- information about the SHA of the commit being reverted in the following
format: `This reverts commit <SHA>`,
- a clear description of the reason for reverting the commit message.
